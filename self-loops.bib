abstract = {Objective
To characterize activity, text sentiment, and online community characteristics regarding “fertility” on Twitter before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using social network analysis.
Design
Cross-sectional analysis.
Setting
Publicly available Twitter data.
Patient(s)
Not applicable.
Intervention(s)
Not applicable.
Main Outcome Measure(s)
Number of users (vertices); edges (connections, defined as unique and total); self-loops (tweet without connection to another user); connected components (groups of users communicating back and forth frequently); maximum vertices in a connected component (largest group size); maximum and average geodesic distance (number of tweets to connect two users in the network); graph density; positive and negative sentiment tweets; and top 5 hashtags and top 5 word pairs.
Result(s)
There were 1426 unique users and 401 groups in the pre-COVID-19 data compared to 1492 unique users and 453 groups in the during COVID-19 data. There was no difference in the number of total connections (96.8% [1381/1426] vs. 96.0% [1433/1492]) or self-loops (20.0% [286/1426] vs. 22.1% [329/1492]) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The percentage of unique connections per user decreased during COVID-19 (91.6% [1381/1508] pre-COVID-19 vs. 83.3% [1433/1720] during COVID-19). The average and maximum distance between users in the community increased during COVID-19 (maximum: 5 pre-COVID-19, 8 during COVID-19; average 1.95 pre-COVID-19, 2.43 during COVID-19). The percentage of positive sentiments per total number of tweets increased during COVID-19 (58.1% pre-COVID-19 [773/1331] vs. 64.3% [1198/1863] during COVID-19). The top 5 hashtags changed during COVID-19 to include COVID-19. The top word pairs changed from “family, hereditary; parents, children” to “fertility, treatment; healthcare, decisions.”
Conclusion(s)
Despite the challenge to the fertility community amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall Twitter sentiment regarding fertility was more positive during than before the pandemic. Top hashtags and word pairs changed to reflect the emergence of COVID-19 and the unique healthcare decision-making challenges faced. While the character, the number of users, and the total connections remained constant, the number of unique connections and the distance between users changed to reflect more self-broadcasting and less tight connections.}

abstract = {Pig movements play a significant role in the spread of economically important infectious diseases such as the African swine fever. Characterization of movement networks between pig farms and through other types of farm and household enterprises that are involved in pig value chains can provide useful information on the role that different participants in the networks play in pathogen transmission. Analysis of social networks that underpin these pig movements can reveal pathways that are important in the transmission of disease, trade in commodities, the dissemination of information and the influence of behavioural norms. We assessed pig movements among pig keeping households within West Kenya and East Uganda and across the shared Kenya–Uganda border in the study region, to gain insight into within-country and trans-boundary pig movements. Villages were sampled using a randomized cluster design. Data were collected through interviews in 2012 and 2013 from 683 smallholder pig-keeping households in 34 villages. NodeXL software was used to describe pig movement networks at village level. The pig movement and trade networks were localized and based on close social networks involving family ties, friendships and relationships with neighbours. Pig movement network modularity ranged from 0.2 to 0.5 and exhibited good community structure within the network implying an easy flow of knowledge and adoption of new attitudes and beliefs, but also promoting an enhanced rate of disease transmission. The average path length of 5 defined using NodeXL, indicated that disease could easily reach every node in a cluster. Cross-border boar service between Uganda and Kenya was also recorded. Unmonitored trade in both directions was prevalent. While most pig transactions in the absence of disease, were at a small scale (<5km) and characterized by regular agistment, most pig sales during ASF outbreaks were to traders or other farmers from outside the sellers’ village at a range of >10km. The close social relationships between actors in pig movement networks indicate the potential for possible interventions to develop shared norms and mutually accepted protocols amongst smallholder pig keepers to better manage the risk of ASF introduction and transmission.}

abstract="The aim of this chapter is to show the relationship between the nominations for seats in the Cabildo of Buenos Aires between 1776 and 1810 and the network status of councilmen and their families. To this end, we test hypotheses on the relation of network metrics of elite individuals and families with political positions in the council. We find that actors and families with higher degree of connectedness are statistically associated with entrance and access to more prominent positions in the council as indicators of political power. Specifically, more centralized connections seem to assist individuals on the road to higher positions. In the case of families, a more dense structure of overlapped connections may have assured that more members reached higher positions in the Cabildo.",

ABSTRACT = {We present a generalised complex contagion model for describing behaviour and opinion spreading on social networks. Recurrent interactions between adjacent nodes and circular influence in loops in the network structure enable the modelling of influence spreading on the network scale. We have presented details of the model in our earlier studies. Here, we focus on the interpretation of the model and discuss its features by using conventional concepts in the literature. In addition, we discuss how the model can be extended to account for specific social phenomena in social networks. We demonstrate the differences between the results of our model and a simple contagion model. Results are provided for a small social network and a larger collaboration network. As an application of the model, we present a method for profiling individuals based on their out-centrality, in-centrality, and betweenness values in the social network structure. These measures have been defined consistently with our spreading model based on an influence spreading matrix. The influence spreading matrix captures the directed spreading probabilities between all node pairs in the network structure. Our results show that recurrent and circular influence has considerable effects on node centrality values and spreading probabilities in the network structure.},

abstract="Centrality is a key property of complex networks that influences the behavior of dynamical processes, like synchronization and epidemic spreading, and can bring important information about the organization of complex systems, like our brain and society. There are many metrics to quantify the node centrality in networks. Here, we review the main centrality measures and discuss their main features and limitations. The influence of network centrality on epidemic spreading and synchronization is also pointed out in this chapter. Moreover, we present the application of centrality measures to understand the function of complex systems, including biological and cortical networks. Finally, we discuss some perspectives and challenges to generalize centrality measures for multilayer and temporal networks.",

abstract = {Social networks are an interesting class of graphs likely to become of increasing importance in the future, not only theoretically, but also for its probable applications to ad hoc and mobile networking. Rumor spreading is one of the basic mechanisms for information dissemination in networks; its relevance stemming from its simplicity of implementation and effectiveness. In this paper, we study the performance of rumor spreading in the classic preferential attachment model of Bollobás et al. which is considered to be a valuable model for social networks. We prove that, in these networks: (a) The standard PUSH–PULL strategy delivers the message to all nodes within O(log2n) rounds with high probability; (b) by themselves, PUSH and PULL require polynomially many rounds. (These results are under the assumption that m, the number of new links added with each new node is at least 2. If m=1 the graph is disconnected with high probability, so no rumor spreading strategy can work.) Our analysis is based on a careful study of some new properties of preferential attachment graphs which could be of independent interest.}
